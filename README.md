# Baseball Stats Counter

## Basic Requirement

File baseball.py is created to meet the following requirements:
1. Solution is written entirely in Python and saved in a file named baseball.py
2. Correct usage of one or more regular expressions to parse and extract data from each line of the input file
3. Script prints a usage message if a command line argument is not present

## Extra Parts

File baseball-v2.py is a little different with baseball.py
Put all text filename into a list, and results for all text would be printed. No need to input text filename in the console.

If use baseball.py, please input 'python baseball.py {filename.txt}
If not input filename.txt, message "Usage: baseball.py filename" would be printed

If use baseball-v2.py, please input 'python baseball-v2.py', and results for all text files would be printed
